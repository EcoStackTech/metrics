## [8.1.1] - 2025-01-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### **Common Metrics Consistency**
- **Energy Unit Conversion**: Fixed energy_kwh field to properly convert from Wh to kWh (divide by 1000)
- **Entity ID Sanitization**: Sanitized workflow and job names in entity_id by replacing special characters with underscores
- **Location Detection**: Added intelligent location detection for GitHub-hosted runners (US East/Virginia)
- **JSON Formatting**: Fixed location JSON to properly quote string values or use null

#### **Data Consistency Improvements**
- **Consistent Entity IDs**: All entity IDs now follow the format `org/repo-sanitized_workflow-sanitized_job-run_id`
- **Accurate Energy Values**: Energy consumption now correctly displayed in kWh instead of Wh
- **Location Data**: GitHub-hosted runners now show actual location instead of null values

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Location Detection**: Added timezone-based location detection for better geographic accuracy
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback values for energy calculations when bc is not available
- **Sanitization Logic**: Robust character replacement for workflow and job names in entity IDs
