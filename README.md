## üîß Installation

### Repository Level

1. Add the action to your workflow file (see Quick Start above)
2. The action will automatically authenticate based on your repository

### Organization Level

1. Go to your organization's **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
3. Install the EcoStack Metrics app from the GitHub Marketplace
4. Grant access to repositories you want to monitor

## üìà API Response Format

The action sends a unified JSON payload to your API with consistent structure for dashboard aggregation:

### üîÑ **Unified Structure Benefits**
- **Consistent Aggregation**: Common metrics enable dashboard aggregation across all sources
- **Geographic Analysis**: Location data for regional breakdowns
- **Category Filtering**: Business and technical classification
- **Entity Tracking**: Unique identification for specific pipelines
- **Energy Data**: Raw energy consumption for accurate carbon calculations

## üåç Carbon Footprint Calculation

### Energy Data Collection
The action collects raw energy consumption data (`energy_kwh`) and sends it to the EcoStack API, where accurate carbon footprint calculations are performed using real-time carbon intensity data.

### What the Action Provides
- **Energy Consumption**: Watt-hours based on actual resource usage and duration
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics
- **Pipeline Duration**: Accurate timing for energy calculations
- **Runner Information**: Energy efficiency classification

### What the API Calculates
- **Carbon Emissions**: Based on real-time carbon intensity data
- **Energy Mix Factors**: Dynamic calculations for different regions
- **Carbon Intensity**: Up-to-date values for renewable vs. grid energy
- **Environmental Impact**: Contextual comparisons and insights

### Benefits of API-Side Calculation
- **Real-Time Accuracy**: Uses current carbon intensity data
- **Regional Precision**: Location-specific calculations
- **Dynamic Updates**: Reflects changing energy mix
- **Consistent Methodology**: Standardized across all sources

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. **Place at the End** ‚≠ê
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Recommended: Capture entire pipeline
- name: Measure Carbon Footprint
  uses: EcoStackTech/metrics@v2.0.0

# ‚ùå Avoid: Only measures action time
- name: Measure Carbon Footprint
  uses: EcoStackTech/metrics@v2.0.0
  # ... other steps after this
```

### 2. **Enable Enhanced Metrics**
```yaml
- name: Measure Carbon Footprint
  uses: EcoStackTech/metrics@v2.0.0
  with:
    include_system_stats: true      # Resource monitoring
    capture_pipeline_metrics: true  # Pipeline duration tracking
```

### 3. **Monitor Pipeline Efficiency**
- Track the ratio of action time to total pipeline time
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Set carbon footprint targets for your team

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Resource not accessible by integration"**
- Ensure the action has `contents: write` permissions
- Check that the repository is accessible to the action

**"Could not determine pipeline start time"**
- This is normal for some event types
- The action will fall back to action duration measurement

**High carbon footprint values**
- Review your pipeline efficiency
- Consider using GitHub-hosted runners (100% renewable)
- Optimize build times and resource usage

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository.
